### Examples

a. single file sort

```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/media.file -o /path/to/store/folder
./mediarizer --input /path/media.file --output /path/to/store/folder
```

b. directory sort

```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/folder -o /path/to/store/folder
./mediarizer --input /path/folder --output /path/to/store/folder
```

c. flags can be used in any order

```
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -f mp4,jpg,png -o /path/to/store/folder
./mediarizer -o /path/to/store/folder -i /path/source/folder -f mp4,jpg,png
```

d. this execution will only sort _mp4_ and _jpg_ files to move direcotry

```bash
./mediarizer -i  /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -f mp4,jpg
```

e. will only copy photos _not_ videos:

```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -p
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder --photo
```

f. will only copy photos _not_ videos:

```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -v
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder --video
```

g. duplicates files will be moved to folder _"duplicates"_:

```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -d
```

<div id="3-3">

### Additional Information

> a. photos without exif data can be organized with date of creation in the file system using flag -d<br>
> b. from photos with same name, only the first encountered is moved to new directory<br>
> c. `Makefile make clean` will clear folder from executables<br>
> d. unsupported files are not being copied<br>
> e. corructed files may or may not cause the program to crash<br>
> f. using cloud storage services like (iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc) may result in files not being sorted
> as data is actually only on remote servers and you locally can see a shortcut of the remote file
