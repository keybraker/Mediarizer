## How it works

<br>
>These is achieved in one run of the program

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have downloaded g++ (on macOS clang++ is installed with Xcode installation).
2. If you want to achieve better performance you should download OpenMP for multithreading.
[ExifTool by Phil Harvey](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) is used to parse metadata but is 
already implemented so there is no need for you to download it.

### Installation

1. Open a terminal window and cd to cloned project
```bash
cd .../Mediarizer
```

2. To compile the program just type:
```bash
make or make threaded
```

## Usage Guide

### Flags
| flag name	| flag acronym	| Description																| State		|
| :---		| :---			| :----																		| :---		|
| -photo	| -p			| _organizes *only* photos_													| working	|
| -video	| -v			| _organizes *only* videos_													| working	|
| -type		| -t			| _organizes *only* given [file type(s)](https://exiftool.org/#supported)_  | working	|
| -del		| -d			| _deletes files in source directory_										| working	|
| -dup		| -s			| _duplicates are moved into duplicate folder in move directory_			| beta		|
| -dux		| -x			| _duplicates are deleted_													| beta		|
| -hlp		| -h			| _displays a usage guide of Mediarizer_									| working	|
| -vrs		| -v			| _displays current version_												| working	|

> a. Multiple flags can be used in conjunction<br>
> b. Multiple [file types](https://exiftool.org/#supported)_ can be used as comma-separated string ex: -type jpg,png<br>
> c. Duplicate photos are compared by type, size, date and resolution, only than are they categorized as same<br>

***

### Additional Information 
> a. from photos with same name, only the first encountered is moved to new directory<br>
> b. ```Makefile make clean``` will clear folder from executables<br>
> c. unsupported files are not being copied<br>
> d. corructed files may or may not cause the program to crash<br>

### Examples
a. Single image mode: Organises the one picture or video given to it.
```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/media.file -o /path/to/store/folder
```

b. Folder mode: Organises all the pictures and videos in a folder, and the folders in it.
```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/folder -o /path/to/store/folder
```
##### Flags can be put in any order you wish even in the middle of the directories, like this:
```
./mediarizer -mp4 -i /path/source/folder -jpg -o /path/to/store/folder -png
```
is the same as,
```
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -mp4 -jpg -png
```
***
##### Will only copy jpg and mp4 files:
```bash
./mediarizer -mp4 -jpg -i  /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder
```
***
##### Will only copy photos not videos:
```bash
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -photo
```
***
##### Duplicates will be deleted:
```bash
./mediarizer -dup -i  /path/source/folder
```
***
##### **! Only _videos_ will be copied:**
```bash
./mediarizer -video /path/media.file /path/to/store/folder
```
***
##### **! This is _NOT_ valid because -dup can only be used alone:**
~~```bash ./mediarizer -dup /path/media.file /path/to/store/folder -jpg```~~
