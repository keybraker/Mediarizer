## How it works
```text
make       |----------------| ./mediarizer /media.file /path/to/store           |------------------| 
---------> |   mediarizer   |-------------------------------------------------> | organised photos | 
      	   |----------------| ./mediarizer /path/folder /path/to/store          | in year/month    | 
                    |                                        	                |------------------| 
                    |
                    |         ./mediarizer -dup /path/folder                    |------------------| 
                    \---------------------------------------------------------> | duplicate free   | 
      	                                                                        | folders          | 
                                                            	                |------------------|

<br/>**_( This is achieved in one run of the program )_**

Why use Media Organizer:
* Fast and easy organisation of photos / videos
* Lightweight and runs on all harware and OS
***

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have downloaded g++ (on macOS clang++ is installed with XCODE installation).
2. If you want to achieve better performance you should download OpenMP for multithreading.
[ExifTool by Phil Harvey](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) is used to parse metadata but is 
already implemented so there is no need for you to download it.

### Installation

#### 1. Open a terminal window and cd to cloned project
```
cd .../Mediarizer
```

#### 2. To compile the program just type:
```
make 
```

## Usage Guide

##### a. Single image mode: Organises the one picture or video given to it.
```
./mediarizer -i /path/media.file -o /path/to/store/folder
```
##### b. Folder mode: Organises all the pictures and videos in a folder, and the folders in it.
```
./mediarizer -i /path/folder -o /path/to/store/folder
```
##### c. Duplicate mode (BETA): Deletes all duplicate pictures and videos in a folder, and the folders in it.
```
./mediarizer -dup /path/folder
```
***

> Photos are copied to the new path if date information is available. <br/>Same photos with same names, from diffrent folders are not being copied.

> To clean the program type ``` make clean ``` in ``` /mediarizer ```.

> All corrupted or unsupported files are not being copied. If even one file is copputed or unsupported, a txt file is created called ``` corruptedFiles ```, in which every corrupted or unsupported file is listed by its full path, so that you can handle it manually.

> Better run duplicate mode after organizing. It may be more cpu and time consuming but you can guarantee a fully, free of duplicates library due to the siple fact that duplicate files are only searched in current folder.

> Keep in mind that duplicate mode is in its early stages of production so better use it in small folders. Works best when you have already used media organizer and than done some more organizing of events due to making folders smaller.
***

_Duplicate Mode Output:_
```
> |-is file.        
> |-same size.      
> |-same date.      
> |-same res.       
> '-rm -rf "/path/to/file.type" ( stored for deletion ).
```

## Flags
Category | Explanation
---------| -------------
-photo	 | _for photo organization only_
-video	 | _for video organization only_
-jpg   	 | _for jpg organization only_
-png   	 | _for png organization only_
-avi   	 | _for avi organization only_
-mov   	 | _for mov organization only_
-wmv   	 | _for wmv organization only_
-mp4   	 | _for mp4 organization only_
-mts   	 | _for mts organization only_
-hlp   	 | _for Media Organizer User Guide_
-vrs   	 | _for Version infromation_
-dup   	 | _(BETA) duplicate mode stores duplicates in file duplicatesToDelete.txt and than askes you to check the duplicates and delete them (use with caution)_
-dux   	 | _(BETA) duplicate mode extreme deletes duplicates when it finds them, faster than normal verison but the machine will keep the file with the smallest ASCII name (use with caution)_
-del   	 | _deletion mode deletes all source files keeping only the copies in destination path_

* **You can use multiple flags, in order to transfer only the selected file types**

***
#### Flag Use Examples:
##### Flags can be put in any order you wish even in the middle of the directories, like this:
```
./mediarizer -mp4 -i /path/source/folder -jpg -o /path/to/store/folder -png
```
is the same as,
```
./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -mp4 -jpg -png
```
***
##### Will only copy jpg and mp4 files:
```
./mediarizer -mp4 -jpg -i  /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder
```
is the same as,
```
./mediarizer -mp4 -i  /path/source/folder -jpg -o /path/to/store/folder
```
***
##### Will only copy photos not videos:
```
./mediarizer -i  /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -photo
```
***
##### Duplicates will be deleted:
```
./mediarizer -dup -i  /path/source/folder
```
***
##### **! Only _videos_ will be copied:**
```
./mediarizer -video /path/media.file /path/to/store/folder -jpg
```
***
##### **! This is _NOT_ valid because -dup can only be used alone:**
~~```./mediarizer -dup /path/media.file /path/to/store/folder -jpg```~~
***
